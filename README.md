# Brick-Breaker-Game-Logic-and-Rendering-Panel-Java-
This project is a classic arcade-style Brick Breaker game developed using Java and Swing for the graphical user interface (GUI). Inspired by popular retro games like Breakout and Arkanoid, the game offers an engaging and dynamic experience where players control a paddle to bounce a ball and break bricks arranged at the top of the screen.
